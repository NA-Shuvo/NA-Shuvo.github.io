                        The great writer Ahmed Sofa(1943) died in 2001. He participated in the Liberation war of Bangladesh. He was also a direct witness Of the Anarchy that occurred in the countryafter the war.The extraordinary mind of Ahmed Sofa did not fail to grasp the historical significance of the liberation war. That is why the resurgence of communalism in country’s politics hurt him. But how was this impossible matter made possible?

                        He sought the answer of this question in mid 1970's. And now, after 30 years later, we see that his analysis was largely correct. The real enemy of secularism in Bangladesh is the ideology of nationalism. Under the safe-shadow of this nationalism, communal difference and conflicts have developed. This is Ahmed Sofa’s one of the most important propositions. Following Antonio Gramsci, We have named this proposition - 'The Passive Revolution'.

                        It was mid or late 1976 when I first met Ahmed Sofa. At that time he lived in the International Student Dormitory of Dhaka University. His room number was 107. At the time of our meeting he was translating Faust by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. (Translator's note: Sofa's translation was not a direct translation from German language). Within a few days he started writing another book titled <em> Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota </em> - the Political Complexity of Bangladesh. The immediate destination of both writing was once famous monthly periodiacal <em>Samakal</em>. The publication of this periodiacal ceased shortly after the death of famous poet, editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikandar_Abu_Zafar">Sikandar Abu Zafar</a>. Later, at one time, another great man tried to regularize its publication and he was poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Hafizur_Rahman">Hasan Hafizur Rahman</a>. It is better to start our rumination from there.

                        Let's start with the statement of the author himself. Sofa stated regarding his book <em> Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em>:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <q>
                        I had started writing the book a few months ago, probably a seven months ago. I was continuing my writing and the work of composing was underway to publish it in a issue of Samkal, a monthly periodical established by Late Sikandar Abu Zafar. About one third of the present work was composed. I can assume that a standard portion was also published. At such a time, Samakal authority notified me that due to some 'special reasons' that I can not tell correctly, they were not interested to pubish it anymore in their paper.
