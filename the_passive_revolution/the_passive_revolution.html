                        The legendary writer Ahmed Sofa(1943) died in 2001. He participated in the Liberation war of Bangladesh. He was also a direct witness Of the Anarchy that occurred in the countryafter the war.The extraordinary mind of Ahmed Sofa did not fail to grasp the historical significance of the liberation war. That is why the resurgence of communalism in country’s politics hurt him. But how was this impossible matter made possible?

                    <p>
                        He sought the answer of this question in mid 1970's. And now, after 30 years later, we see that his analysis was largely correct. The real enemy of secularism in Bangladesh is the ideology of nationalism. Under the safe-shadow of this nationalism, communal difference and conflicts have developed. This is Ahmed Sofa’s one of the most important propositions. Following Antonio Gramsci, We have named this proposition - 'The Passive Revolution'.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        It was mid or late 1976 when I first met Ahmed Sofa. At that time he lived in the International Student Dormitory of Dhaka University. His room number was 107. At the time of our meeting he was translating Faust by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. (Translator's note: Sofa's translation was not a direct translation from German language). Within a few days he started writing another book titled <em> Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota </em> - the Political Complexity of Bangladesh. The immediate destination of both writing was once famous monthly periodiacal <em>Samakal</em>. The publication of this periodiacal ceased shortly after the death of famous poet, editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikandar_Abu_Zafar">Sikandar Abu Zafar</a>. Later, at one time, another great man tried to regularize its publication and he was poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Hafizur_Rahman">Hasan Hafizur Rahman</a>. It is better to start our rumination from there. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with the statement of the author himself. Sofa stated regarding his book <em> Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em>:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <q>
                        I had started writing the book a few months ago, probably a seven months ago. I was continuing my writing and the work of composing was underway to publish it in a issue of Samkal, a monthly periodical established by Late Sikandar Abu Zafar. About one third of the present work was composed. I can assume that a standard portion was also published. At such a time, Samakal authority notified me that due to some 'special reasons' that I can not tell correctly, they were not interested to pubish it anymore in their paper.  
                        </q>
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        Finally, <em>Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em> was published in <em>Diganta</em>- an infamous and soon-to-be-dead irregular periodical. The editor was Mr. Kalimdad Khan. What was the 'special reason' of Samakal authority will be clear if the last chapter of the book is gone through. Ahmed Sofa might have not thought it decent to tell it explicitly. In this text we will try to rediscover it. What we are saying here is neither the first word nor the last one. We will not be surprised if new thinkers come and disprove our proposition. But we must sing our song. 
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Before that I must delay a little to start. The book <em>Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em> was published- by luck- in May 1, 1977. Due to being unprinted for a long time, this unknown text has been also lost like <em>Diganta</em>- that poor periodical.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately, a few days before his untimely death, Ahmed Sofa agreed to publish a new book titled- <em>Bangladesh Rashtro O Bangalee Jatee</em>. <em>Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em> was reprinted again as an included text of the aforementioned book. As a book <em>Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em> had ten chapters in total when it was first published. But as an appended text to the em>Bangladesh Rashtro O Bangalee Jatee</em>, the last chapter- chapeter 10 was missing. Did Ahmed Sofa compromise with the same 'special reason'- for which the Samakal authority refused to publish it 24 years ago? We will not search for the answer of this question here. After the writer's expiry, being  commissioned by <em>Bonedi Prokashoni</em> my respected teacher the legendary <a href="https://bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A6_%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%B2_%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8#:~:text=%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A6%20%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%B2%20%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%20(%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AE%3A%20%E0%A7%A8%E0%A7%A7,%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%20%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A1%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF%20%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%20%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%20%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9B%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8%E0%A5%A4">Morshed Shafiul Hasan</a> reproduced Sofa's <em>Nirbachito Probondho</em>-'The Selected Eassys'in 2002. He also acknowledged that the text <em>Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em> is a rare one. It is quite understandable that this hard trailed editor did not have the luck to go through the original edition of the text. He assumed that its first publication was in 1978. This mistake is forgiveable. But we see that he was not even interested in the chapter that was dropped off by the writer himself. But we politely admit that we have that courage to examine it. Begum Husne Ara Haque, the wife of late Azizul Haque, has donated a portion of her husband's collected books to the library of Bangladesh Asiatic Society. A copy of Sofa's original version of <em>Bangladesher Rajnoitik Jotilota</em> has been found there and we have collected- with the acknowledgement of debt- a xerox copy from there. In our opinion, there are some pretexts in regard to reprint the book from beginning to end instead of partially. We will try to tell them one after one.
