        <h1>Problem 2: Missing Transitive Pairs</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
                                                                                                            <br/>
            Transitive relation is a special type of relation in Mathematics. A relation R on set X is      <br/>
            transitive if for all elements a,b,c in X, whenever R relates a to b and b to c, R must relate  <br/>
            a to c. As a non-mathematical example, the relation "is an ancestor of" is transitive. For      <br/>
            example, if Amy is an ancestor of Becky, and Becky is an ancestor of Carrie, then Amy, too, is  <br/>
            an ancestor of Carrie.                                                                          <br/>
            <br/>
            Now, for the purpose of this problem we denote the symbol T as the transitive relation operator <br/>
            between two operands i.e. numbers. Now, let's say X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. A relation R is    <br/>
            R is given bellow:                                                                              <br/>
            <br/>
            R = (1T2, 2T3, 4T7, 7T5, 7T6). According to the definition, R is NOT a transitive relation      <br/>
            because if 1T2 and 2T3, there must be 1T3 in R which is missing. Similarly the other 2 missing  <br/>
            pairs are 4T5 and 4T6.                                                                          <br/>
            <br/>
            In this problem, you will be given a relation R. You have to find out the missing pairs for R   <br/>
            to be transitive.

        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
            The first line of input consists of an integer n where 0 < n <= 10000. The following n lines    <br/>
            will consist of a string as a pattern of relation such as '1T2', '533T612'.                     <br/>  
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>
            You have to print the missing pairs in xTy format, single pair in a line and must follow the    <br/>
            following rules:                                                                                <br/>
            <br/>
            1.  Between two pairs xTy and wTz, if x > w, print pair xTy before pair wTz.                    <br/>
            2.  Between two pairs xTy and xTz, if y > z print pair xTy before pair xTz.                     <br/>
            3.  If there is NO missing pair, print <b>No missing pair</b>                                   <br/>
