        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
                                                                                                            <br/>
            Shila is new in coordinate geometry. So she is very naive. She is facing problem in solving     <br/>
            a basic geometry problem. Shila has three integer coordinates. She needs to find the area of    <br/>
            the triangle enclosed by the connected edge of those coordinates. Help her to find the area.    <br/>

        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
            Input consists of three lines. Each line consists of two space separated integers.              <br/>
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>
            Output is only a floating point number with three decimal places after the radix point.         <br/>
        </p>
