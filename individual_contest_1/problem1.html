        <h1>Problem 1: Integer Decomposition</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            From number theory it is guaranted that any integer can be decomposed into the difference       <br/>
            of two square numbers, let's say x^2 and y^2 with (x>y). But this decomposition does not give   <br/>
            guarante x and y to be integers. For example, the number 13 can be decomposed as 7^2 - 6^2.     <br/>
            Here 7 and 6 are integers. But the number 26 doesn't have such integer decomposition. On the    <br/>
            other hand there are many integers having more than one integer square decomposiotions. 24 is   <br/>
            such a number. It can be decomposed as 7^2 - 5^2 and 5^2 - 1^2. So, it has two decompositions.  <br/>
            <br/>
            In this problem you will be given an integer and you have to tell the number of valid possible  <br/>
            integer square decomposiotions.

        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
            Input consists of only one integer n such that 0 <= n <= 10^5. 
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>
            Only an integer that represents the number of valid possible integer square decomposiotions.    <br/>
            If infinite number of decompositions is possible, print <b>inf</b>.                             <br/>
        </p>
